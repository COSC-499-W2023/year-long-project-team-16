- Learning Extent Reports or other methods to create testing reports for presentations.
- Finding ways to extend the code for dashboard testing (testing the content inside of a form rather than only testing if the form exists and is displayed)
- Figuring out how to conduct automation testing to see if the links / buttons on the dashbaord are interactive. (finished creating testing to see if elements of the dashboard are present)

### Tasks Completed
- added 2 alternative functions for testing incorrect username and password to the login and registration test.
- created testing for the dashboard with functions testing the presence of the sidebar, heading, logo, menu items, and the content generate form.

- Creating the 'My Settings' page for the dashboard.
- Learning how to implement APIs.

### Tasks Completed 
- Created 2 testing files using Selenium and Pytest.
- The first test file was designed to test every element in the dashboard after testing wehther the log-in was successful.
- The second file tests only the dashboard element without having to log-in, as we did not integrate the log-in page and the dashboard page before the presentation

### Tasks in progress
- Finding appropriate settings that suits our web application.
- Learning to display each setting page within the main settings page.
- For example: I have profile settings, notifications, and preferences as the 3 options in the main settings page. I'm learning how to display each of these 3 pages within the main settings page through the js script.
- Implementing APIs

### Tasks completed
- Creating the settings page and matching the overall format of the web application. The settings page includes all 3 options mentioned above, and forms inside of each of the page. Next steps are to use js to have these pages open up on the main settings page instead of a new URL.

### Tasks in progress
- I have created forms for each setting, for example, the Account Settings would have a form that is populated with the user's name, username, email and password, and then the notification settings would have a form that controls the notifications. I am having a fair bit of trouble figuring out how to display these forms on the main settings page once the option clicked.
- Displaying these forms in the main settings page (when the sepcific setting option is clicked) is executed via the js script. My next step is writing the unctional javascript code inside of the HTML file using the <script> tags to see if I can result in a more efficient outcome.

### Tasks Completed
- The overall look of the setting page with the 3 settings options displayed.
