This week I create a kanban board on Trello to keep our tasks tracked and organized, with due dates and member assignment to tasks, along with dividing tasks into sections based on their completion and/or type of task. Also i commenced work on a figma mockup incorporating design elements to help visualize the features we would like to incorporate in our project
